# MajorOps

MajorOps is an early, working exploration of how emergency-service patterns
can be applied to major IT incidents.

The goal is simple: improve clarity, coordination, and recovery during
high-impact system failures by borrowing proven ideas from domains that
operate under time pressure and uncertainty.

This repository is intentionally incomplete and evolving.

## What this project is

MajorOps looks at questions such as:
- How should major incident calls actually function under stress?
- What roles are necessary when systems are failing and information is partial?
- How do you reduce noise without slowing recovery?
- What preparation is genuinely useful before an incident occurs?

The emphasis is on **operating behavior**, not tools (that comes next).

---

## What this project is not

At this stage, MajorOps is not:
- a finished framework
- a vendor solution
- a replacement for existing incident management practices
- a prescription for day-to-day operational work

Think of this as a set of notes, drafts.

## Emergency-service inspiration

Emergency services (dispatch, fire, EMS, aviation operations) have spent
decades refining how humans coordinate during emergencies.

MajorOps explores whether some of those patterns — such as:
- clear speaking roles
- centralized call control
- pre-defined response information
- separation of recovery from analysis

translate usefully into major IT incidents.

## Repository structure (early)

This repository is organized like a manuscript rather than a product:

- Short written sections
- Incremental additions
- Minimal tooling assumptions

Expect structure and content to change as ideas are tested and refined.

## Project status

**Status:** v0.1 / exploratory  
**Audience:** operations, reliability, and incident leaders  
**Pace:** intentionally slow and incremental

Content will be added in small, discrete pieces rather than large drops.

---

## Feedback

Thoughtful feedback and discussion are welcome.
At this stage, clarity and correctness matter more than completeness.

---

## A note on how this is written

Some of the writing in this repository is drafted with the help of AI tools to
speed up iteration and editing.

The content itself is based on real-world experience and existing practices
from areas like emergency services, public safety communications, government
training, and large-scale technical operations. When specific external sources
or standards are referenced, they’ll be called out as the material develops.

The goal here is to work a bit faster — not to invent ideas out of thin air.
